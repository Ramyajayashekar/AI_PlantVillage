ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Prediction
A deep learning-based application for detecting plant diseases from leaf images using a Streamlit web interface.

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project leverages deep learning techniques to identify plant diseases from leaf images. The model is trained on a dataset of various plant diseases and healthy leaves. A user-friendly Streamlit application allows users to upload images and receive predictions along with recommendations for disease management.

ðŸš€ Features
Upload plant leaf images for disease prediction
AI-powered classification using deep learning (CNN model)
Provides disease name and treatment recommendations
Generates a downloadable Plant Disease Prediction Report (PDF)
Easy-to-use Streamlit web interface

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras
Web Framework: Streamlit
Model Training & Evaluation: Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas
Data Handling: Google Drive (for model storage), gdown
Report Generation: ReportLab
